      <h2>This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing.</h2>
      <p>It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I have read over the years.</p>

      <p>Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads.</p>

      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans)</li>
        <li>175g of tahini</li>
        <li>6 sundried tomatoes</li>
        <li>Half a red pepper</li>
        <li>A pinch of cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
        <li>A dash of olive oil</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <ol class="steps">
        <li>Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely</li>
        <li>Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely</li>
        <li>Add all the ingredients into a food processor</li>
        <li>Process all the ingredients into a paste</li>
        <li>If you want a coarse “chunky” hummus, process it for a short time</li>
        <li>If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time</li>
      </ol>

      <p>For a different flavour, you could try blending in lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese.</p>

      <h3>Storage</h3>
      <p>Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You can use it for about a week after you've made it.</p>

      <p>Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.</p>
